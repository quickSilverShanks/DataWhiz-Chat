Explanation of "google/flan-t5-xl" Parameters:

max_length: Set this to a higher value if you want longer responses. For example, max_length=300.
num_beams: Increasing this can lead to more thorough exploration of possible sequences. Typical values are between 5 and 10.
do_sample: Set this to True to use sampling methods. This can produce more diverse responses.
temperature: Lowering this value makes the model more confident and deterministic, while higher values increase diversity. Typical values range from 0.7 to 1.5.
top_k and top_p: These parameters control nucleus sampling. top_k limits the sampling pool to the top k tokens, while top_p uses cumulative probability to cut off the sampling pool. Adjust these based on the desired level of randomness.
